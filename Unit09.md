**Unit 9: The Developing World** <span id="9"></span> 
*Less developed countries (LDCs) face a number of obstacles both in
obtaining needed resources and in making better use of their current
available resources.  If a country is to improve the lot of its
citizens, what is the best way to do it?  Are the policies used by
developed nations appropriate for LDCs?  Because each country is
different in size, natural endowments, history, and other critical
factors, one set of policies may not fit all.  But are there common
indicators and approaches pointing a nation towards the improvement of
the quality of life for its inhabitants?  Is the government a better
promoter of development than the marketplace?  Should agriculture be
given priority or should resources be used to build up industry?  To
quote Nobel Laureate Robert Lucas, “The consequences for human welfare
involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts
to think about them, it is hard to think about anything
else.” <sup>[1]</sup>  Economic development is one of the most diverse
topics in contemporary economics and provides us with a variety of ways
to both identify problems and offer fundamental solutions.*

    increase in per capita income.

    Malthusian trap, and explain why his dire predictions have not
    occurred in many countries in modern times.

    it has proceeded in very different ways in developed versus

**9.1.1 Definition of LDC** <span id="9.1.1"></span> 
*Note: Economists define lesser developed countries (LDCs) as being poor
(as measured by per capita GDP) and as being un-modern.*

**9.1.2 Characteristics of LDCs** <span id="9.1.2"></span> 
*Note: LDCs are primarily agricultural producers; industrial production
accounts for less than 10% of GDP.*

**9.1.3 Vicious Circle of Poverty Argument** <span id="9.1.3"></span> 
*Note: The vicious circle of poverty argument centers around the theory
that one problem causes another problem that then causes the initial
problem again (i.e.* post hoc ergo propter hoc*, or after this,
therefore because of this).  For example, if an individual has a limited
education, or if an individual has no special job skill sets and is also
unemployed, then the theory supposes that the person will always be
unemployed or the individual will always be a low wage earner.*

**9.3.1 Industry versus Agriculture** <span id="9.3.1"></span> 
*Note: Industry and agriculture are equally important.  The theory is
that without agriculture, a country cannot exist, but without industry,
a country also cannot exist.  In other words, a country needs both
industry and agriculture as a functioning part of its economy.*

**9.3.2 Import Substitution** <span id="9.3.2"></span> 
*Note: Economists find value in engaging in import substitution based on
the theory of comparative advantage, which means that respective
country’s seek goods that have a lower opportunity cost.  Consequently,
import substitutes may enable greater domestic purchases within its
borders.*

**9.3.3 Export Promotion** <span id="9.3.3"></span> 
*Note: Export promotion centers on the idea of attracting more firms to
export their products by providing assistance in product and market
identification and development, training trade fairs, and foreign
representation.  In other words, firms explore opportunities to sell
more products abroad, consequently enabling more revenue funds as well
as GDP growth.*

**9.3.4 Market-Based Solutions** <span id="9.3.4"></span> 
*Note: A number of industries (food, energy, communication,
environmental, etc.) engage in market-based solutions in order to drive
change for economic growth.  A market-based solution is one that is
brought about when a philanthropist, such as Michael Saylor of the
Saylor Foundation or Bill and Melinda Gates of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation, enables innovation in a facet of industry to expand and be
productive for the workforce and consumers.*
