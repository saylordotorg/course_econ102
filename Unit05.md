**Unit 5: Government and Fiscal Policy** <span id="5"></span> 
*What effect does a government have on an economy?  Through its ability
to tax, a government takes away a proportion of its people’s income, but
it also injects money into the economy by printing currency and
purchasing public goods.  What are the consequences of these actions?
 Clearly, government spending and taxing will have an effect on the
equilibrium GDP, but by what magnitude?  How do those policies affect
inflation, unemployment, and economic growth?  Macroeconomics studies
these and other questions pertaining to the relationship between a
government and an economy.  In doing so, it often uses the concept of
the multiplier, which, as you learned in the previous unit, refers to
the relationship between a change in spending and the impact that change
has on the entire economy.  In this unit, we will explore these issues
and examine other government policies, such as budgets, debts, and
deficits, discussing their respective effects on the economy as a
whole.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the major components of U.S.
    government spending and sources of government revenues.
-   Define the terms budget surplus, budget deficit, balanced budget,
    and national debt, and discuss their trends over time in the United
    States.
-   Compute Government Spending Multiplier, the Tax Multiplier, and the
    Balanced Budget Multiplier.
-   Define automatic stabilizers and explain how they work.
-   Explain and graphically illustrate how discretionary fiscal policy
    works and compare the changes in aggregate demand that result from
    changes in government purchases, income taxes, and transfer
    payments.
-   Explain how the various kinds of lags influence the effectiveness of
    discretionary fiscal policy.
-   Explain and graphically illustrate how crowding out (and its
    reverse) influence the impact of expansionary or contractionary
    fiscal policy.
-   Discuss the controversy concerning which types of fiscal policies to
    use, including the arguments from supply-side economics.

     Instructions: This material elaborates on the major components of
    government spending and the sources of government revenue.  You will

    budget, and national debt.  Read the section in its entirety,
    including the introduction, noting trends in the U.S. government’s
    budget over time.  Lastly, try to answer the questions in the “Try
    It” box at the end of each section before reviewing the solutions
    that follow.

     Instructions: On the right side of the navigation bar, click on
    “Chapter 9: Fiscal Policy.”  This chapter discusses the concepts
    associated with fiscal policy, and contains an answer key to assess
    understanding of the material.  Note that this material also covers
    the topics outlined in subunits 5.2.1-5.2.3.

**5.2.1 Government Spending Multiplier** <span id="5.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The government spending multiplier is a tool used to manipulate
the economy and mitigate inflation or recession that goes beyond the
ordinary uses of taxes.  In this process, the government spending
multiplier deploys additional monies or restricts monies to assist in
economic stability.*

**5.2.2 Tax Multiplier** <span id="5.2.2"></span> 
*Note: The tax multiplier is a tool used to manipulate the economy and
mitigate inflation or recession that goes beyond the ordinary uses of
taxes.  In this process, the tax multiplier uses the manipulation of
taxes, which is known as fiscal policy.*

**5.2.3 Balanced Budget Multiplier** <span id="5.2.3"></span> 
*Note: The balanced budget multiplier operates within the context of
aggressively reducing a deficit by collecting more taxes to enable the
government’s revenue to match its expenses.*

    Demand”](http://faculty.washington.edu/danby/notes/notes910.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This material covers subunits 5.3.1-5.3.3.  Scroll
    through these lecture notes to section 1.12, “Counter Cyclical and
    Pro-cyclical Policies,” and read all the way up to section 1.15,
    “Further Notes.”  The government’s fiscal actions can stabilize the
    business cycle by changing aggregate demand.  This can be done
    either by an act of Congress requiring a change in a spending
    program or in a tax law (which are both examples of discretionary
    fiscal policy), or it can be triggered by the state of the economy
    (which is known as automatic fiscal policy).  The readings in this
    subunit will elaborate on the mechanisms of both kinds of policies
    and will also touch upon the problems that arise when managing
    fiscal policy.  The following resources will elaborate on the
    concepts that are presented in this material.

     Instructions: This material will cover subunits 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.
     Read all of section 2 to learn about how the government’s fiscal
    actions influence aggregate demand.  This section first discusses
    automatic stabilizers and how they function.  The chapter then
    covers discretionary fiscal policy, which are changes in aggregate
    demand resulting from changes in government purchases, income taxes,
    and transfer payments.

**5.3.1 Automatic Stabilizers** <span id="5.3.1"></span> 
*Note: Automatic stabilizers are the non-discretionary occurrences that
mitigate fluctuations in GDP.  When that happens, the government
non-discretionally receives taxes or revenue from its citizenry rather
than making a discretionary decision.  This topic was briefly introduced
in Paj Holden’s YouTube video listed under 1.3.1.*

**5.3.2 Discretionary Fiscal Policy** <span id="5.3.2"></span> 
*Note: Discretionary fiscal policy is how the executive and legislative
branches exercise their choice of increasing or decreasing taxes to
attain economic stability.*
