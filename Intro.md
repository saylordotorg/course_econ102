Economics is traditionally divided into two parts: microeconomics and
macroeconomics.  The purpose of this course is to provide you with a
fundamental understanding of the principles of macroeconomics. 
Macroeconomists study how a country’s economy works and try to determine
the best choices to improve the overall wellbeing of a nation.  Typical
topics include inflation (the overall level of prices), employment,
fiscal policy (government taxing and spending), and money and banking
(interest rates and lending policies).  Individuals and firms need to
consider how macroeconomic events will affect their own prosperity.  To
better define macroeconomics, consider its distinction from
microeconomics.  Imagine you are attempting to figure out how the price
of a certain good has been determined.  Microeconomics would focus on
how supply and demand determine prices, while macroeconomics would study
the determination of prices at all levels.  To test particular policies
and ideas, or to find out the causes of good macroeconomic performance,
we need to have some measure of overall economic activity.  For this
reason, macroeconomics uses aggregates (totals) to measure key concepts
such as national income, output, unemployment, inflation, and business
cycles (periodic expansions and contractions of economic activity).  By
studying macroeconomics and understanding the critical ideas and tools
used to measure economic data, you will have a better perspective on the
issues and problems discussed in contemporary economics.  This course
will ask you to think critically about the national and global issues we
currently face.  It will also introduce the tools and principles you
need to draw your own conclusions in an informed manner.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Discuss key macroeconomic concerns, including national income
    accounting, saving and investment, and market forces.
-   Describe the determinants of total output and the ways to measure
    nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as well as real GDP.
-   Compare and contrast definitions of total employment and
    unemployment, the three forms of unemployment, and inflation.
-   Explain different ways of computing the general movement in prices,
    and define the relationship between inflation and unemployment.
-   Explain the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply.
-   Analyze the government’s role in the economy and examine how it uses
    its fiscal policy and monetary policy to influence macroeconomic
    variables in order to enable macro and micro economic stability.
-   Describe the mechanics of money supply in detail.  Specifically, the
    student will be able to identify different types of money; explain
    the money creation process, the money multiplier, and the process of
    interest rate determination; and discuss the role of the Federal
    Reserve System and its tools of monetary policy.
-   Identify and analyze major theories of economic growth.
-   Analyze various strategies for developing of less-developed nations.
-   Present the concepts behind international trade.

### Course Requirements

 √    Have access to a computer.  
  
 √    Have continuous broadband internet access.  
  
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.

discipline.

### Course Information

Welcome to ECON102.  General information about this course and its
requirements can be found below.  
  
 This course uses a variety of tools to explain how the economy works. 
Pay close attention to the definitions of key words and take note of how
they are used in an economic context.  Graphs and charts explain trends
and present complex sets of information in a visual format.  Math is
used to develop models, measure the effect of policies, and help make
decisions.  This combination of words, graphs, and math to explain the
same concept can make economics a challenging area of study.  As you
work through the course, think about how you perceive the information
and other possible ways to explain ideas.  
  
 **Course Designers:** Jubeet Kaur, [Dr. Bob
McKizzie](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-h-n/#DrBobMcKizzie), and
[Professor Tony
Pizur](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-o-t/#ProfessorTonyPizur)  
  
 **Peer Reviewers:** Heather Luea, Edward Hoang, and Robert (Bob)
McKizzie  
  
 **Primary Resources**: This course is comprised of a range of
different, free online materials.  The course makes primary use of the
following materials: 

-   [*Principles of
    Macroeconomics*](http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/printed-book/1629)
-   University of Wisconsin-Madison: Robert Schenk, PhD’s
    [“CyberEconomics”](http://ingrimayne.com/econ/mainmenu.htm)
-   SUNY-Oswego: Professor John Kane’s [“Principles of
    Macroeconomics”](http://www.oswego.edu/~kane/eco200.htm)
-   PEOI.org: Professor John
    Petroff’s [*Macroeconomics*](http://www.peoi.org/Courses/Coursestu/mac/fram1.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** To complete this course, students will
need to read the information in each unit.  Students will gain knowledge
and reinforcement of course concepts by completing the assessments,
quizzes, and tests that accompany the assigned reading material.  You
will notice that most of the assessments are listed in Unit 1.  Careful
attention to Unit 1 is important, because it establishes the basis for
latter units.  You will need to complete the following: 

-   Sub-subunit 1.1.1 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 1.1.2 Test 1 and Test 2
-   Sub-subunit 1.3.2 Test 1 and Test 2
-   Subunit 1.4 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 1.4.2 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 2.2.5 Homework 1
-   Sub-subunit 3.1 Review Questions
-   Sub-subunit 3.1.4 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 3.3 Test
-   Subunit 4.1 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 4.2.4 Quiz
-   Subunit 5.2 Assessment
-   Sub-subunit 5.3.3 Test 1 and Test 2
-   Subunit 6.2 Quiz 1 and Quiz 2
-   Subunit 8.4 Quiz
-   Sub-subunit 10.4.2 Quiz and Test
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam. 
The assessments, quizzes, and tests will help you to prepare for the
Final Exam.  Final Exam scores will be tabulated upon completion.  If
you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of **94.25
hours** to complete.  Each unit contains a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you to plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take
a look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 10.75 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (a
total of 5 hours) on Monday and Tuesday; subunit 1.2 (a total of 2.25
hours) on Wednesday, etc.  
  
 **Tips/Suggestions: **As you complete the readings, it is advised that
you take careful notes related to the main concepts.  You may also
consider creating a glossary of the different economic terms used in
this course.  The notes and glossary will be useful to you as you study
for your Final Exam.
