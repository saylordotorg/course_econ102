**Unit 2: Measuring Aggregate Output** <span id="2"></span> 
*One of the major focuses of macroeconomics is the total output
generated by an economy by looking at Gross Domestic Product (GDP), or
the total value of all final goods and services produced within a
nation’s borders, even if produced by foreign companies.  It also
examines Gross National Product (GNP), which measures all the final
goods and services produced by a country’s citizens, even if produced in
other countries.  Over time, two important instruments have been
developed to calculate GDP and GNP: expenditure and income.  We will
examine both of these in this unit.  
  
 Macroeconomics also focuses on the difference between nominal GDP
(i.e.  GDP calculated according to today’s prices, and ignoring
inflation) and real GDP (i.e.  GDP calculated in actual purchasing
power).  This is an important distinction, because an economy might be
growing in nominal terms while its real GDP (what people can actually
purchase domestically or in imports) is declining because of inflation.
 In this unit, we will discuss these scenarios and participate in the
debate over whether the GDP is an accurate measure of well-being.*

     Instructions: This section describes the Gross Domestic Product
    (GDP) as a measure of final goods and services using expenditure. 
    It also distinguishes the GDP from the Gross National Product (GNP).
     Note that total output (also referred to as aggregate output) is
    the amount of production that the economy has generated in a given
    period of time.

**2.4 Final Goods and Services** <span id="2.4"></span>

     Instructions: Scroll down to and read the section entitled “Final
    Goods and Value Added.”  Final goods and services are finished
    products that are produced in a given year.  For example, a fully
    manufactured automobile is a final good.  The products that are used
    to manufacture final goods are called intermediate parts or inputs
    and are not “counted”: all of the resources or inputs that are used
    to manufacture an automobile are only counted as one completed
    product.  If the intermediate parts are counted as well as the final
    good, it is known as “double counting”; this can diminish the
    accuracy of the GDP measurement.

**2.5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) vs. Gross National Product (GNP)**

    National Income Accounting”**

    Accounting”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Chapter-5-National-Income-Accounting-Petroff.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Scroll down to and read the information on Gross
    National Product and Gross Domestic Product.  Gross Domestic Product
    refers to production counted within a country’s borders, whereas
    Gross National Product refers to production by domestic factors both
    inside and outside of a country’s borders.  In modern times, the
    Group of Seven (G7), Group of Eight (G8), and the Group of 20 (G20)
    use the GDP formula in measuring GDP growth, so the global economy
    uses the same formula to measure each country’s economic welfare or
    well-being.  This ensures that countries are on the same accounting
    page.  Note that some countries use GNP as a metric, but GDP is the
    standard accounting system.

     Instructions: This section details the computational method for
    calculating total output in the economy using income.  Please
    attempt the “Try It” problems at the end of the chapter and review
    the correct answers.  
      
     Income is the other side of the national income accounting process.
     For a country (or household) to be efficient, it must be able to
    detail the sources of its income. The point of the national income
    accounting system is to determine efficiency of a country, much like
    one would do in one’s own household.  Economists seek data about
    income as well as expenditure; ideally, the two should be in balance
    (that is, they should be the same amount).  When income and
    expenditure are balanced, the country (or the household) is said to
    have a balanced budget.

    GDP and Economic Well Being”**

    Being”](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/textbooks/Principles%20of%20Macroeconomics.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this section to learn about the limitations of
    the GDP statistics.  Since GDP exclusively measures the expenditures
    and income of an country, the measurement of that country's economic
    welfare does not always take into account all of the components of
    the country’s well-being.  There are several criticisms regarding
    using GDP as a measure of economic well-being.  Some of the
    criticisms are that the GDP does not take into account non-market
    activities, leisure time, product quality, the underground economy,
    the environment, the composition and distribution of output, or any
    non-economic sources of well-being.

    the economy, GPI and GNH are generally thought of as a holistic tool
    that governments and communities use to measure the real costs and
    benefits of economic activity.  The GPI and GNH count beneficial
    activities as positive and harmful activities as negative, and
    provide us with a means to combine economic issues with
    environmental and social concerns.  The GPI and GNH are synonymous
    terms.  Economics has loaded terminology; there are a number of
    different terms that have identical meanings.  GPI and GNH are also
    referred to as Measurements of Economic Welfare (MEW).
