**Unit 7: Labor Market** <span id="7"></span> 
*In microeconomics, the four factors of production are usually
identified as land, capital, entrepreneurial talent, and labor.  Using
macroeconomics, we will now examine the labor factor, asking how wages
affect the economy and how activities such as investment, consumption,
and inflation impact the real wages of labor.  In an ideal world,
economies would make full use of available material and human resources.
 This unit explores how certain policies and practices often prevent the
full employment of capital, land, and labor.  In this unit,
macroeconomics will help you study labor markets in order to determine
optimum levels of employment and identify the strategies that make the
best use of all available resources.*

**7.1.1 Labor Demand and Supply Curves** <span id="7.1.1"></span> 
*Note: Labor demand is based occurs when marginal resource product is
greater than the marginal resource costs; it is based on a calculation
of derived demand or a need for supply.  In regards to supply curves, if
wages are high, then the supply curve slopes upward.  If wages are low,
then the supply curve’s slope is less steep.  This is correlated to the
laborer’s incentive to work; however, regarding employer incentives, the
supply curve will demonstrate an incentive at the bottom of the upward
slope for more labor at a lower wage and incentive for less labor at a
higher wage.*

**7.2.1 Classical Views** <span id="7.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The classical view of unemployment is that if the wage is higher,
more people will want to work, and if the wage is lower, fewer people
will want to work.  If the employer needs or wants more workers, it will
increase wages to act as an incentive.  If there is a great supply of
workers, employers will reduce wages.*

**7.2.2 Keynesian View** <span id="7.2.2"></span> 
*Note: The Keynesian view of unemployment is that unemployment is a
result of inadequacies in an economy and differences in aggregate supply
and aggregate demand.*

**7.3.1 The Philips Curve Defined** <span id="7.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered in the material for subunit 7.3.*

**7.3.2 The Philips Curve Breakdown and Stagflation** <span
id="7.3.2"></span> 
*Note: The Phillips curve demonstrates that there is a trade-off between
inflation and unemployment.  According to the curve, when inflation is
higher than expected, people will work at a lower real wage.  Employers
will in turn hire more workers at the lower real wage, increasing output
and reducing unemployment.  In the 1970s and 1980s, when both inflation
and unemployment were continually rising (a phenomenon known as
“stagflation”), many economists questioned the soundness of the Phillips
curve.*
