**Unit 6: The Money Supply and the Monetary Policy** <span
id="6"></span> 
*What is money?  Most people probably think of bills and coins, but in
this course, we will define it as the asset most commonly used to buy
things, or the medium of exchange commonly used by buyers and sellers. 
In today’s economy, money can take many forms, from checks to electronic
payments to e-money and a variety of other instruments that facilitate
production and trade.  Money is also a unit of account; it helps us
measure value in an economy and is a store of purchasing power over
time.  The ways in which we define and measure money, in addition to the
institutions we have built around it, help us understand the role of
money and its importance in a well-functioning economic system. 
Interest rates, or the prices that coordinate economic activity over
time, also play a significant role in the supply and demand of money as
a form of savings and investment.  
  
 As an economy grows, financial innovations develop new assets measured
as money while central banks develop appropriate aggregates to measure
them.  These measures include M1 (currency, checking account deposits,
and travelers checks) and M2 (money market accounts and other assets
such as savings accounts and repurchasable agreements).  Of course,
because our behavior and beliefs determine what we will accept as money,
money measurement is an ever-expanding subject in macroeconomics.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 13.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.1: 1 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.2: 2 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 6.3: 1 hour

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define money and discuss its three basic functions.
-   Distinguish between the types of money, i.e. between commodity money
    and fiat money, giving examples of each.
-   Define money supply and the related definitions of it (M1 and M2).
-   Explain the functions of a bank and describe a bank’s balance sheet.
-   Describe the process of money creation (destruction) using the
    concept of the deposit multiplier.
-   Explain the primary functions of the central bank and describe the
    tools used by the Fed for money market operations.
-   Explain and illustrate how the bond market works and discuss the
    relationship between the price of a bond and that bond’s interest
    rate.
-   Explain and illustrate the relationship between a change in demand
    for or supply of bonds and macroeconomic activity.
-   Explain and illustrate how the foreign exchange market works and how
    a change in demand for a country’s currency or a change in its
    supply affects macroeconomic activity.
-   Draw a money demand curve and explain how changes in other variables
    may lead to shifts in the money demand curve.
-   Use graphs to explain how changes in money demand or money supply
    are related to changes in the bond market, in interest rates, in
    aggregate demand, and in real GDP and the price level.

**6.1.1 The Three Functions of Money** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The three functions of money are acting as a medium of change
(that is, a means of payment), a store of value (that is,
a “safe” or “vault,” for assets) and a unit of account (that is,the
total cost of an item).*

**6.1.2 Two Types of Money** <span id="6.1.2"></span> 
*Note: The two types of money are currency (paper money) and checkable
deposits (checks).*

**6.1.3 Measuring Money: M1 and M2** <span id="6.1.3"></span> 
*Note: M1 money involves checkable deposits.  M2 money involves M1
(checkable deposits), small time deposits, money market mutual funds,
and funds held by individuals.*

**6.1.4 Commercial Banking** <span id="6.1.4"></span> 
*Note: Commercial banking includes the financial intermediaries that
buy, sell, invest, and save money for businesses and the public.*

**6.2 Money Creation** <span id="6.2"></span> 
**6.2.1 Defining Total, Required, and Excess Reserves** <span
id="6.2.1"></span> 
*Note: Total reserves are the checkable deposits that the public has
placed in a commercial bank.  Required reserves are a percentage of the
checkable deposits that must remain in a commercial bank as required by
the Federal Reserve.  Required reserves are set by the Federal Reserve
to protect banks from customers “running” on the bank, i.e., reserves
protects a bank from customer panic.  Excess reserves are a percentage
of checkable deposits that a bank is authorized by the Federal Bank to
lend out.  Consequently, required reserves are deposits that the banks
actually earn a profit from.*

*Note: The required reserve ratio is set by the Federal Reserve to
encourage full employment, economic growth, and price stability by
controlling the money supply.  Typically, the required reserve ratio is
between 1 and 3 percent; it may even increase to ten percent based on
the Federal Reserve’s desire to minimize recessionary or inflationary
gaps.*

*Note: One of the interpretations of the money demand curves is based on
an economy’s interest rate.  This interpretation rests on the position
of the supply of money and the interest rates on money.  Regarding
shifting factors, the money supply can increase based on lower interest
rates or decrease based on higher interest rates.*
