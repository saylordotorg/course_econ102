**Unit 1: Introduction to Macroeconomics** <span id="1"></span> 
*To build a solid house, one needs a solid foundation.  In
macroeconomics, this foundation centers on a few key questions: How do
we measure overall economic activity?  What are the relevant aggregates
(totals) needed to measure overall economic activity?  What role do
governmental and other institutional policies play in an economy?  What
are some important components that affect the whole economy?  Because
macroeconomics concerns itself with so many different parts of the
economy, it is critical to focus on these key questions and ideas before
moving on to the parts themselves.  
  
 This first unit outlines important concepts and relates them to the
economy as a whole.  We will first address growth, unemployment, and
inflation as the three central concerns of macroeconomics.  Next, we
will identify critical public policies, such as money creation (monetary
policy) and taxes and spending (fiscal policy), exploring their
respective effects on an economy.  Finally, we will take a look at a
diagram that shows the circular flow of the resource market (income) and
the product market (goods and services).  
  
 In this unit, you will also learn how macroeconomics developed in the
1930s as a result of a debate between economists, who believed that
market and price mechanisms should be able to adjust in order to resolve
economic downturns and depressions, and others, who believed periodic
economic dislocations could be managed through the use of public
policies and government intervention.  This debate is as relevant today
as it was in the 1930s.*

**1.1.2 Microeconomic Connections and Foundations** <span
id="1.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This sub-subunit will revisit concepts you learned in ECON101:
Principles of Microeconomics.  This section will review the basic model
of demand and supply, the concept of equilibrium, and the way markets
operate in an economy.  Do not rush through these readings; it is
important to fully understand these topics.  It may also be helpful to
practice sketching demand and supply graphs on your own in order to see
how equilibrium values change with curve shifts.*
