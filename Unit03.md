**Unit 3: Unemployment and Inflation** <span id="3"></span> 
*The average person understands the economic concepts of unemployment
and inflation: unemployment reflects number of people out of work, and
inflation indicates a rising price level of goods and services. 
Macroeconomics, however, distinguishes between the labor force, which
includes both employed and unemployed (those able and willing to work
but not currently working), and those not in the labor force (full time
students, nonworking spouses, and retirees).  It also differentiates
between frictional unemployment (or temporary unemployment), structural
unemployment (affecting whole sectors of the economy), and cyclical
unemployment (caused by downturns in the economy).  
  
 Inflation, or a rise in the general level of prices of goods and
services, causes the purchasing power of the dollar (or any other
monetary unit, like the euro, yen, or pound) to decline.  By
distinguishing between nominal income (the actual amount of money) and
real income (the amount of goods and services it can buy),
macroeconomics helps measure the effects that inflation has on an
economy and on its constituents’ standards of living.*

**3.2.4 Problems with the CPI** <span id="3.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This information also touches on the topic outlined for
sub-subunit 3.2.3.  Consumer Price Index (CPI) calculations are
restricted to the consumers’ purchasing behavior only in the context of
price increases of goods and services from one period of time to
another.  CPI does not take into account the producer price index, or
PPI.  The PPI is a measure of the average change over time in the
selling prices received by domestic producers for their output.  
  
 An upside having so many indices to measure inflation is that each one
of the GDP deflator (GDP price index), CPI, and PPI serves as a measure
of the same inflationary tendencies, but measures it in a slightly
different way.*
