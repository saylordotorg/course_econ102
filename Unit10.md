**Unit 10: International Trade** <span id="10"></span> 
*Why do nations trade goods and services with each other?  How do they
decide what to export and what to import?  Should nations protect their
industries from foreign competition by using tariffs and quotas?  In
this unit, we will take a look at some of these questions.  
  
 The concept of “trade” is an important element in economics.  As
workers, we trade our time and effort for the goods and services our
wages will buy.  When we study international trade, the same logic
applies: two people will not trade unless they both expect to gain; both
sides must see profit, or they will refuse trade.  Finally, people will
not sell goods unless they want to buy other goods.  This is true at an
individual level and, more generally, for every nation.  By trading with
each other, trading partners benefit if they can buy a good or service
more cheaply than they can produce it domestically.  
  
 Macroeconomics uses accounting and other tools to measure trade and
determine the effect that certain changes have on economic activity.  By
looking at a country’s trade balance and the rate at which its currency
trades, we can begin to understand why the economy is doing what it is
doing at a particular point in time. *
