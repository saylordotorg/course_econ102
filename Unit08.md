**Unit 8: Economic Growth** <span id="8"></span> 
*What determines economic growth?  Is it an increase in land use or
capital?  What role does productivity play in economic growth?  What
public policies are best for promoting economic growth – and which are
worst?  This is the stuff of newspaper headlines and public policy
debates.  In this unit, we will address these and other issues
pertaining to economic growth.  
  
 According to macroeconomics, an economic system refers to the process
by which inputs (capital, land, and labor) are transformed into certain
outputs (the goods and services people wish to purchase).  The political
and legal environment under which economic activity takes place largely
determines whether or not the economy expands and grows.  Unstable
political climates, confiscatory taxation or burdensome regulations will
tend to restrict production and trade.  In a situation where property
and contracts are respected, specializations and innovations in
technology are occurring, and investment spending is rising, the economy
grows and both investment goods and consumption goods increase.*

**8.2.1 Labor** <span id="8.2.1"></span> 
*Note: Labor can be defined as a resource of physical talents,
intellectual talents, and efforts used to produce goods and services.*

**8.2.2 Capital** <span id="8.2.2"></span> 
*Note: Capital can be defined as resources, such as buildings,
machinery, and equipment that are used to produce goods and services.
 Capital goods are non-labor intensive.*

**8.2.3 Human Capital (or Entrepreneurial Talent)** <span
id="8.2.3"></span> 
*Note: Human capital or entrepreneurial talent are the intellectual
properties and intellectual training that enables a person to be more
productive.*

**8.2.4 Productivity** <span id="8.2.4"></span> 
*Note: Productivity involves the lowest production cost of a good or
service.  In other words, the productivity of labor is determined by
dividing total output by the costs of the input (labor resource).*
