**Unit 4: Aggregate Demand and Supply** <span id="4"></span> 
*Since macroeconomics studies the whole economy, it looks at the main
forces affecting growth, inflation, and unemployment by aggregating, or
totaling, output (via the GDP) and prices (via a price index).  Unlike
microeconomics, which studies the demand and supply of individual goods
and services, macroeconomics considers demand and supply for all goods
and services in a national economy.  
  
 In macroeconomics, aggregate demand is the total amount of goods and
services people want to buy – in other words, it measures what people
wish to purchase rather than what is actually produced.  The aggregate
demand is the sum of consumption, investment, government expenses, and
net exports.  Aggregate supply, on the other hand, is the total output
an economy produces at a given price level.  As you learned in
microeconomics, firms achieve equilibrium when they produce the quantity
of goods and services consumers want to buy, that is, when aggregate
supply equals aggregate demand.  This unit examines shifts in aggregate
supply and aggregate demand and their short-term and long-term effects
for the whole economy.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 12.25 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 4.75 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 4.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Assessments: 3 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Define aggregate demand, graphically represent a hypothetical
    aggregate demand curve, and identify the reasons for the negative
    slope of the demand curve.
-   Distinguish between a change in the aggregate quantity of goods and
    services demanded and a change in aggregate demand.
-   Define “multiplier” and explain how to calculate it.
-   Graphically represent a hypothetical long-run aggregate supply curve
    and explain the underlying connotations for natural levels of
    employment and output at various price levels, given changes in
    aggregate demand.
-   Graphically represent a hypothetical short-run aggregate supply
    curve, explain why it slopes upward, and explain why it may shift.
-   Discuss various explanations for wage and price stickiness.
-   Explain and illustrate what is meant by equilibrium in the short run
    and relate the equilibrium to potential output.
-   Explain and graphically represent the consumption function and the
    saving function, explain the slopes of their respective curves, and
    explain their relationship to each other.
-   Compare the current income hypothesis with the permanent income
    hypothesis.
-   Discuss two factors that can cause the consumption function to shift
    upward or downward.

    Aggregate Demand and
    Supply”](http://www.oswego.edu/~economic/eco200/chap9.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: These are introductory notes about aggregate demand
    and supply.  Read this entire set of lecture notes for an overview
    of the demand and supply model in the macroeconomic context.  For
    Aggregate Demand (AD), please pay special attention to the
    components that constitute aggregate demand and the factors that
    affect each of these components resulting in shifts of the AD
    curve.  These lecture notes also explain why the AD curve is
    negatively-sloped.  (For those who have studied Microeconomics, note
    that the reason for the negative slope of the AD curve is different
    than what it was for the individual/market demand curve.)  For
    Aggregate Supply (AS), please be aware of the distinction between
    the Short-Run AS curve and the Long-Run AS curve and the factors
    that lead to shifts or changes in the two curves respectively. 
    Finally, look at how the AD and the AS interact to reach
    equilibrium.  This material also covers sub-subunits 4.1.1-4.1.6.

**4.1.1 Components of Aggregate Expenditure (Consumption, Investment,
Government Purchases, and Net Exports)** <span id="4.1.1"></span> 
*Note: The four components of the GDP (consumption, investment,
government purchases, and net exports) contribute to the aggregate
demand for goods and services.*

**4.1.2 Slope of the Aggregate Demand Curve** <span id="4.1.2"></span> 
*Note: The aggregate demand curve slopes downward due to the price level
and consumption (the wealth effect), the price level and investment (the
interest rate effect), and the price level and net exports (the exchange
rate effect).  Economists refer to each of these effects as independent
variables (or causes).  Economists refer to outcomes as the effects. 
Consequently, cause and effect is the reason that the aggregate demand
curve has a downward slope.*

**4.1.3 Shifts of the Aggregate Demand Curve** <span id="4.1.3"></span> 
*Note: There are numerous factors that affect the quantity of goods and
services demanded at a given price level.  When a factor changes, the
aggregate demand curve shifts left or right.*

**4.1.4 Aggregate Supply in the Short- and Long-Run** <span
id="4.1.4"></span> 
*Note: The short-run aggregate supply curve slopes upward due to the lag
between product prices and resource prices that makes it profitable for
firms to increase output when the price level rises.  The long-run
aggregate supply curve is vertical when a country is at full
employment.  The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because in
the long run resource prices adjust to changes at the price level, which
leaves no incentive for firms to change their output.  In the long run,
prices and wages have no effect on the aggregate supply curve.*

**4.1.5 Shifts in the Aggregate Supply Curve** <span id="4.1.5"></span> 
*Note: Price levels can cause changes or shifts in the aggregate supply
curve.  Determinants (domestic prices, prices of imported resources, or
market power in certain industries) also cause shifts in the aggregate
supply curve (moving left or right).*

**4.1.6 Macroeconomic Equilibrium** <span id="4.1.6"></span> 
*Note: Macroeconomic equilibrium is determined when a country’s data
indicates that its GDP is equal to its aggregate expenditures and when
its savings is equal to its investments.*

    level.  Also notice how the slope of the aggregate expenditures
    curve relates to the multiplier.
